# Dyson DC41 Vacuum - Canister Release Button Replacement

This is the OpenJSCAD code for a 3D printable model of the Dyson DC41
vacuum cleaner canister release button. I have had two of these original parts
break.

This is my stab at creating a replacement part that hopefully will last a bit
longer.
