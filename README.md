# Dyson DC41 Vacuum - Canister Release Button Replacement

This is the OpenJSCAD code for a 3D model of the Dyson DC41 vacuum cleaner
canister release button. This code can pasted in at http://openjscad.org,
rendered, viewed, and can also generate a .stl file for 3D printing this
model.

I have a Dyson DC41 Animal vacuum cleaner. I like it because I have 2 dogs
and it works great on dog hair. However, the plastic piece used as the release
button for the canister, has broken twice. That little plastic part is sold
in the UK, but not as easily available in the US (though you can find it on
EBay for about $16). The first time this broke on me, I ended up buying a
whole new canister for $50+.

I decided to try my hand an modeling a replacement myself using OpenJSCAD,
and this is what I came up with. I tried to make the area of the top section
of the piece (where the breaks occurred on the original part) a little more
robust.

This may also work for the Dyson DC43 as well, but I don't have one if those
to verify that.

Generated models based on this code can also be found on the Thingiverse
site at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1730585. The images directory
contain some pictures of a 3D printed version of the model and how it looks
in use.
